This repository presents principles, guidelines and opinions on how to build software for Telekom Austria Group.

### Status of this document

- [ ] Target Platform: Which platform should be used (e.g. JVM based, NodeJS, Ruby) for what kind of development (e.g. for throw away stuff use NodeJS because of speed and productivity, for "tracer" code and production relevant stuff use a JVM langugage etc)
- [ ]  Language Guideline: Best practices for Java, NodeJS, whatever (there are a lot of very comprehensive guidelines out there that we can reuse)
- [ ]  Deployment Approach: How to package and deliver applications (e.g. traditional AppServer based delivery vs. fat JARs vs. dockerized applications)
- [ ]  Logging/Debugging: How to handle logs, debugging and profiling
- [ ]  Performance related stuff
- [ ]  Documentation
- [ ]  Versioning (it will be GIT but which git workflow to apply is the question)
